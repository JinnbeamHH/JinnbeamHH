# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Benjamin** – a Fullstack Web and Software Developer with a focus on React TypeScript Frontend, Java Spring Backend, Data Engineering, Dev Ops with Docker and Databases like MongoDB and MySQL.

I'm passionate about building usable Websites, Applications, and Data Solutions to constantly learn and evolve with it.

This GitHub is a collection of projects, experiments, and ideas that reflect my journey in both Software- and Webdevelopement. Feel free to dive in.

Projekts for Clients are privat if demanded. The Projects available are mostly made for practical education and for personal usage, Templates.
